# Iterated-Travelers-Dilemma
This code in support of a tournament of strategies playing the Iterated Traveler's Dilemma.  This tournament was the central focus of my master's thesis at the University of Houston.

Papers.zip -
	Contains the LaTex files for every paper submitted/accepted.
	
Logs.zip -
	The results from running the tournament.
	
TD_Tourney - 
	Code for each strategy and for running the tournament itself.  Creates results logs for each strategy.
	
TD_Crawler - 
	Crawls through all the results of the tournament and consolidates them into a single, comma separated value file, all_resullts.txt.
	
TD_Combinatorial_Crawler -  
	Same as above, but rather than keeping every strategy separated, they are grouped according to strategy type, e.g., all Zeuthen scores are combined.
